#Predicting stock market movement based on Tweets
There are thousands of people who take twitter to talk about the stock market everyday. They use tweets to communicate with well renowned pundits and this can be a pretty good indicator of market movement. Using text mining and predictive modeling for predicting such market swings will be fun. 

##Aim:
The goal of this project is to predict the market trends based on tweets from notable stock market pundits.

##Steps:
The plan to acheive the goal contains several small projects. 
1) First step in that long process is to study the correlation between the sentiment of the tweets and stock price movement. 
2) Once the correlations is confirmaed, identify few twitter handles of pundits who are good in communicating the stock market changes.
3) Building a scrapper to get the tweets and using the same text mining principles to prepare the dataset. 
4) Clean the dataset and use machines learning algorithms to predict the stock market trend.
5) Work on improving the Accuracy, Specificity and Sensitivity of the model.
